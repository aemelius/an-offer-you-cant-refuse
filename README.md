# an-offer-you-cant-refuse

A little Clojure program designed to compute prices of apples, oranges and watermelons (and to play a bit with polimorphism).

This season, we decided to go crazy with special offers:

- Buy one apple, get one free!
- Buy three watermelons for the price of two!

PS
Sorry, currently we don't have special offers on oranges.

# Dependencies

You just need leiningen correctly installed on your system.
This was developed with Clojure 1.8.0 and Leiningen 2.8.1 on Java 1.8.0\_152 

# What am I going to find here?

The implementation is in `src/an_offer_you_cant_refuse/core.clj`
The tests are in `test/an_offer_you_cant_refuse` (I used the expectations library)

If you want to run the tests, just run: `lein test`
